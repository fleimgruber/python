# Nixpkgs Python

Extensive collection
of [Python][PYTHON] Packages
from the [Python Packaging Index][PYPI].
That can be installed with the [Nix][NIX] package manager.

## Goal

Packaging every package on PyPI.

- :heavy_check_mark: Pure and reproducible: with Nix
- :heavy_check_mark: Linux and MacOS, all architectures
- :heavy_check_mark: Self contained units:
  The package + its python dependencies + its OS/Lib dependencies.
- :heavy_check_mark:
  All [active python releases][PYTHON_RELEASES] (`3.6`, `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`)
- :heavy_check_mark: Minimal maintainer dedication

## Using

:construction: work in progress
